A Prayer for Rain  
BY LISEL MUELLER  
Let it come down: these thicknesses of air  
have long enough walled love away from love;  
stillness has hardened until words despair  
of their high leaps and kisses shut themselves  
back into wishing. Crippled lovers lie  
against a weather which holds out on them,  
waiting, awaiting some shrill sign, some cry,  
some screaming cat that smells a sacrifice  
and spells them thunder. Start the mumbling lips,  
syllable by monotonous syllable,  
that wash away the sullen griefs of love  
and drown out knowledge of an ancient warâ€”  
o, ill-willed dark, give with the sound of rain,  
let love be brought to ignorance again.
